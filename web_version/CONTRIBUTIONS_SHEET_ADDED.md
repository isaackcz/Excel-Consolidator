# Contributions Sheet & Hyperlinks - Now Added to Web Version!

## ✅ What Was Missing (Now Fixed!)

The desktop app had **3 interactive features** that were missing from the web version. **ALL NOW ADDED!**

---

## 🎯 Features Added

### 1. ✅ **Contributions Sheet** (NEW!)

A detailed breakdown worksheet showing **exactly which files contributed** to each consolidated cell.

**Structure**:
```
| Cell | File Name          | Contribution |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| A5   | School_Report_1   | 100          |
| A5   | School_Report_2   | 200          |
| A5   | School_Report_3   | 300          |
| (blank row - visual separator)
| B5   | School_Report_1   | 85.00%       |
| B5   | School_Report_2   | 90.00%       |
| B5   | School_Report_3   | 75.00%       |
```

**Features**:
- ✅ **Auto-filter enabled** - Filter by cell or file name
- ✅ **Natural sorting** - Cells sorted as A1, A2, ..., B1, B2 (not A1, A10, A2...)
- ✅ **All files shown** - Even files with 0 contribution
- ✅ **Proper formatting** - Percentages show as %, currency as $
- ✅ **Visual breaks** - Blank row between each cell group
- ✅ **Column widths** - Pre-sized for readability

**Desktop App Code** (lines 2325-2406):
```python
contrib_ws = output_wb.create_sheet("Contributions")
contrib_ws["A5"] = "Cell"
contrib_ws["B5"] = "File Name"
contrib_ws["C5"] = "Contribution"
# ... fill data ...
contrib_ws.auto_filter.ref = f"A5:C{r-1}"
```

**Web Version** (lines 733-908):
```python
contrib_ws = workbook.create_sheet("Contributions")
# ... IDENTICAL logic ...
```

---

### 2. ✅ **Clickable Hyperlinks** (NEW!)

Click any consolidated cell → Jump directly to its contribution details!

**How it works**:
1. User clicks cell B5 in main sheet
2. Excel jumps to Contributions sheet, row showing B5's first contribution
3. Can see all files that contributed to that cell

**Desktop App Code** (lines 2408-2417):
```python
for coord in totals.keys():
    first_row = coord_to_first_row.get(coord)
    if first_row:
        cell = output_ws[coord]
        link = f"#'Contributions'!A{first_row}"
        cell.hyperlink = link
```

**Web Version** (lines 843-855):
```python
for coord in totals.keys():
    first_row = coord_to_first_row.get(coord)
    if first_row:
        cell = main_ws[coord]
        link = f"#'Contributions'!A{first_row}"
        cell.hyperlink = link
```

**Result**: ✅ **IDENTICAL**

---

### 3. ✅ **Consolidated (Plain) Sheet** (NEW!)

A clean copy of the consolidated data **WITHOUT** hyperlinks or comments.

**Use case**: For users who want the consolidated data without interactive features.

**Features**:
- ✅ **Full formatting preserved** - Colors, borders, fonts, etc.
- ✅ **All values copied** - Same totals/averages
- ✅ **Column widths** - Same as main sheet
- ✅ **Row heights** - Same as main sheet
- ✅ **Merged cells** - Same merging
- ❌ **NO hyperlinks** - Clean, non-interactive
- ❌ **NO comments** - No cell hover tooltips

**Desktop App Code** (lines 2420-2462):
```python
plain_ws = output_wb.create_sheet("Consolidated (Plain)")
# Copy merged cells
for merged_range in output_ws.merged_cells.ranges:
    plain_ws.merge_cells(str(merged_range))
# Copy column widths, row heights, cell values, formatting
# BUT NOT hyperlinks or comments
```

**Web Version** (lines 857-902):
```python
plain_ws = workbook.create_sheet("Consolidated (Plain)")
# ... IDENTICAL logic ...
```
